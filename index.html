He is one of the most prominent artists within The Wrecking Crew stable, which was formed after he and fellow stable-mates Benchmarq left Ambitiouz Entertainment. His alias is inspired by his star sign Aries, the first astrological sign in the Zodiac often closely associated with Greek mythology of the ram. So the ‘A-R’ stands for ‘Above Reality’, which means that I’m a dreamer, because I know that dreams can come true. The ‘ee’ stands for ‘Exceptionally Emotional’. As a human you are emotional, sometimes you are extremely happy or sad or whatever.</p>
